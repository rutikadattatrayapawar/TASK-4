VALIDATION FORM:
Form validation is a “technical process where a web-form checks if the information provided by a user is correct.” The form will either alert the user that they messed up and need to fix something to proceed, or the form will be validated and the user will be able to continue with their registration process.
Validation forms are important for ensuring that data submitted through a web form is accurate, complete, and meets the required format. Here are the steps involved in validating a form:
Define the form requirements: Before building the form, you need to define what data you want to collect and what format you expect it to be in. For example, if you are collecting an email address, you may want to ensure that the format is correct and that it includes an "@" symbol and a domain name.
Create the form: Build the form with the required fields and any other optional fields that you would like to include.
Add validation rules: Validation rules are used to check that the data entered into the form is valid. You can use JavaScript or other programming languages to write validation rules for each field.
Display error messages: If the user enters invalid data, you should display an error message to let them know what went wrong. Error messages should be clear and concise, telling the user what needs to be corrected.
Test the form: Test the form to ensure that all validation rules are working correctly. You should also test the form with different browsers and devices to make sure that it works on all platforms.
Submit the form data: Once the form is validated, the data can be submitted to the server for processing. You should also provide feedback to the user to let them know that the form has been submitted successfully.
Handle errors: If there are any errors in the form data, you should handle them appropriately. This could involve displaying an error message or redirecting the user to a different page.
